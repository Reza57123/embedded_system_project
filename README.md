Tactile and optical alarm system for deaf people
Project description:
This project is a bracelet that includes the design of a tactile and optical alarm system that when the system is on the hand of deaf people, when there is a danger or a doorbell or a phone call, the bracelet starts to vibrate. When the sensor vibrates, a light also shines and that light also shines in specific colors based on the event, for example, the doorbell shines in yellow, the wake-up call in white, the phone call in orange, the alarm (for example, fire) in red, etc. When a deaf person uses the system, he must memorize the color table based on the type of alarm to understand what happened. When no one is home and only the deaf person is there, all the phone calls, doorbells and alarms should be connected to the system.
Project components:
Input sensors include vibration sensors and optical sensors that can send signals in the event of a specific situation.
The processing unit is a microcontroller that processes signals and decides what type of alarm to give. The output can include a wristband or portable device.
